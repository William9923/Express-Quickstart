# Express Typescript Starter ðŸ“™
---
The main purpose of this repository is to show a working Express.js API Server + front-end project and workflow for writing Node code in TypeScript.
This is the example repository from the MDN tutorial about express js [click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website)

__Live Demo:__ 

## Overview
The following application template follows Uncle Bob [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) principles and project structure.

Please read the post in order to have a good understanding of the server architecture and expressjs.

This clean architecture is based on my intepretation and my skill (cause I'm still new in Javascript world ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…) and only will be used as my own documentation and project template

The API by itself doesn't do anything fancy, it's just a book library CRUD API with some Views to show data. (similar to how the tutorial shows in the post)

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/William9923/Express-Typescript-Starter <project_name>
```
- Install dependencies
```bash
cd <project_name>
npm install
```
- Done! (notes : It still using the Mock Database, need furthur configuration for using Mongoose or Sequelize)

## Application Layer
This Project focus on 3 layers:
- Domain Layer (models)
- Usecase / service layer (notes : implemented in controller, in complex solution need to be created seperately)
- Controller Layer
- Framework / infrastructure layer (daos & views)

## Middleware
Can create custom middleware using this template
Example of custom middleware
- logging middleware : `src\middlewares\logging.ts`

## Config
Config could be seen as a place to put the env variables needed by the application. Also make your env variable available for intellisense in VSCode.

## Utility
Utility / Shared function for the whole project and can be used for many usecase.

## Cron Jobs
Cron job directory is placed in `src/public/scripts`. This project give 2 example of jobs :
- `populate_mongo.js` : Populate db using mongo db
- `populate_postgres.js` : Populate db for postgresql

## Tests
Should be used to store unitest for app service. This project used Jest & Mocha for testing, feel free to change based on your pre

## Scripts
This boilerplate comes with a collection of npm scripts to make your life easier, you'll run them with npm run <script-name> :
- `seed` : to seed database (using mongo or postgres sql)
- `dev` : to run in development environment 
- `start` : to run the application in prod env

ps: All script available in package.json

## The Dependency Rule
> The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is The Dependency Rule. This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular, the name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity.
